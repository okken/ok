# ok

This is `ok`. Or at least, it will be.   
`ok`, right now, is a fork of `pytest`. 

It might grow, or shrink, to be something else.

## This is an "alpha" project, at best.

- Use at your own risk.
- Features are being removed, so no gaurantees.
- You should probably use `pytest`, until the dust settles.

## Installation

You probably don't want to install `ok`. 
You probably want to install `pytest`.

But, if you insist, you can.

```
$ pip install ok
```

Or, more likely

```
$ uv pip install ok
```
