# Contributing

This project is not ready for contributors. 
But please feel free to contribute to pytest.


## Feature removal requests

Is something in `ok` that you think shouldn't be there, please file an issue.


## Report bugs

Report bugs for ok in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/okken/ok/issues).

However, please check to see if it's possibly a bug in pytest. 
Since ok is a fork of pytest, it might be a problem there.
